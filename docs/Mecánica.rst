Introduction
-------
This document describes the milestones achieved by the mechanical team from February to June 2022. During this term, the team’s objectives were to get to know and present the project to the new team members, analyze the car’s status and repair and modify it to make it autonomous. In addition to this, the team's efforts were also concentrated on creating actuation systems such as the steering wheel system, braking system, and sensor mounts.
The main difficulty was the purchase of batteries, but fortunately, VantTec and ZF created a collaborative relationship, where the latter offered to sponsor the team with cash, easing this purchase.

Batteries
-------
As for any electric vehicle, batteries are essential for the car’s operation. During the initial inspection, it was noticed that the installed batteries were no longer functional due to the car’s long-term abandonment and lack of maintenance. Thus, testing most of the systems and components was not possible, resulting in great uncertainty about the vehicle’s condition and operability, therefore, limiting the automation process. Replacing the batteries was set as one of the team’s main priorities.
The electrical team decided that 4 12v batteries were going to be implemented in this car adding up to 48v in a series configuration, which is what the car requires. Due to school purchase protocols and lack of cash this was a major backup in the project progress, With ZF support we will be able to make this purchase and continue with the project.
To this moment the most likely company to serve as our battery provider is LTH with batteries of 12V and 115 Ah
