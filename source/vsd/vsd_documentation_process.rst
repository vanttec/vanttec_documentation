Specific to VantTec projects
============================

We reccomend that when adding a rst file to a VantTec project, you add it by naming it as follows:

* First, make sure the file is in the correct folder, it should be by the initials of the project or by a short name of it.
* For example, if you are going to add a file in which you are going to document the Self Driving vehicle Mechanics
* Shou sould go to the car folder, and add the file sdv_mechanics.rst
* For Specific doubts about the documentation process, please contact Guillermo Cepeda.
