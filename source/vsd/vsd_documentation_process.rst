Documentation process
=====================
In this segment the documentation process of a project is described for VantTec members.

Guidelines for VantTec documentation
===================================
* Always use formal and impersonal language.
| Rst files expected to be added to a project are recommended to be named as follows:
* First, make sure the file is in the correct folder, it should be by the initials of the project or by a short name of it.
| For example, if you are going to add a file in which you are going to document the Self-Driving vehicle Mechanics, you sould go to the car folder, and add the file sdv_mechanics.rst
* For Specific doubts about the documentation process, please contact Guillermo Cepeda.
